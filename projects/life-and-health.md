## Details

Life and Health Network (LHN) is a non-profit organization that offers online content and self-guided courses focused on health and well-being. They are well-kwown for their course on addressing the root cause of Diabetes and Prediabetes with simple lifestyle strategies such as nutrition, exercise, comprehensive testing. LHN wanted to offer this course in a group workshop format.

I took over the project in its early stages. Right away, I knew the platform needed some thoughtful design and aesthetic from the start. I proposed a new visual direction for the application, which eventually grew into a fully new design language for the entire experience.

{{ imageWithCallout.imageWithCallout('/img/lhn-groups-before-2.jpg', 'LHN screenshot', 'Before (Dashboard)', 'lg:max-w-none lg:w-1.5x lg:-ml-1/4 xl:w-2x xl:-ml-1/2 border border-gray-300') }}
{{ imageWithCallout.imageWithCallout('/img/lhn-groups-after-2.jpg', 'LHN screenshot', 'After (Dashboard)', 'lg:max-w-none lg:w-1.5x lg:-ml-1/4 xl:w-2x xl:-ml-1/2 border border-gray-300') }}
{{ imageWithCallout.imageWithCallout('/img/lhn-groups-before-3.jpg', 'LHN screenshot', 'Before (Workshop)', 'lg:max-w-none lg:w-1.5x lg:-ml-1/4 xl:w-2x xl:-ml-1/2 border border-gray-300') }}
{{ imageWithCallout.imageWithCallout('/img/lhn-groups-after-3.jpg', 'LHN screenshot', 'After (Workshop)', 'lg:max-w-none lg:w-1.5x lg:-ml-1/4 xl:w-2x xl:-ml-1/2 border border-gray-300') }}

By taking a componentized approach to designing interface elements, I was able to deliver consistent visual language for the online experience. I tested the concepts with various customers to get feedback on things like onboarding, creating workshops, purchasing materials and getting support.

### Process

Beginning with the call to action on their current marketing site, I prototyped a new onboarding experience to test first.

{{ imageWithCallout.imageWithCallout('/img/lhn-groups-flow-1.jpg', 'LHN screenshot', 'Onboarding flow') }}

{{ imageWithCallout.imageWithCallout('/img/lhn-groups-onboarding-prototype.jpg', 'LHN screenshot', 'Onboarding prototype', 'lg:max-w-none lg:w-1.5x lg:-ml-1/4 xl:w-2x xl:-ml-1/2 border border-gray-300') }}

From there, we continued to design additonal portions of the application with prioirty on the most-important features. We tested each iteration with a couple customers along the way over shared video calls. We eventually worked our way through all major features of the application.
